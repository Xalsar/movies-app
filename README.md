## Potential Improvements (If I Had More Time)
* I would have added **pagination** so users could see all the movies.
* I would have stored the search query in **local storage**, or similar, so that when users return to the movie list, the previous query they used is still present.
* I would have added more tests.
* I would have made the project responsive. (It wasn't a requirement so I did not spend time on it.)
